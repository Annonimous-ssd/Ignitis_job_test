1. clean build gradle project
2. in gradle.build project run generatorTool to generate Schema and tables
3. all rest call is inside swagger, so port of swagger is http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
4. Test were created just to show that it can be created. 
Not much logic put in pass test, because to complete test i need to open separated server port.
